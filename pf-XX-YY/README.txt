As our results are videos, and they are quite big we decided to upload them
on the youtube, this is the link for the playlist containing all videos
-> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4X-xqdmWaKhqpoLLpr7LF9g5MUMJaY_

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to test the code we decided to send the webcam version, mainly because
the input folder would be big and the results would take a long time to process.
So make sure that the docker is able to access webcam, and it has a display
to show the informationss.
